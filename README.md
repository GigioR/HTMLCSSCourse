# HTMLCSSCourse
HTML and CSS course from Next Level Week, by Rocketseat
This one will remain incomplete because the last file got corrupted and they always take the videos down after the week is finished. RIP

I actually learned a lot from the videos I watched: 
- [x] How to start a web projcet
- [x] How to organise the files to fit in a design pattern
- [x] How to CSS my way to a good looking page
- [x] Event Listener
- [x] Back-end in Node.js using Express

What I missed of the last video:
- How to integrate my app with a noSQL data base
- Getting data from the DB and show them on the page
